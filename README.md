# 🐒 Monke Coupon NFT — Web3 Coupon Platform on Solana

Monke Coupon NFT is a blockchain-based project that turns everyday discount coupons into NFTs.  
It allows users to mint, own, transfer, and redeem digital coupons directly on-chain — making coupons secure, verifiable, and borderless.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement & Motivation

Traditional coupon systems are centralized, easy to forge, and difficult to verify across borders.  
Brands lose millions to coupon fraud, and users face issues like expiry confusion, duplication, and non-transferability.  

Monke Coupon NFT solves this by bringing coupons on-chain as NFTs — providing transparency, proof of ownership, and global accessibility.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Coupon Creation: Businesses create coupon NFTs using smart contracts.  
2. Minting: Users can mint unique coupons tied to wallet addresses.  
3. Redemption: Once used, the NFT status changes to “Redeemed” on-chain.  
4. Transferability: Users can trade or transfer unused coupons on marketplaces.
